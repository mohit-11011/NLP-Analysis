I can just imagine Levy going all out against a 3 year old Your elo is over 10x that of Martin.

The fact that he is Bulgarian no surprise he\\'s that big of a moron The best chess master doesn\\'t fear the second best, he fears the worst. Because there is no telling what such moron would do.

It’s like flopping in NBA 😂 Magnus win I think Magnus won because he did the right thing by responding to the check unlike his opponent!😅 The first person to make the first illegal moves to be the loser Does the man comparaing hitler with prophet muhammad How is king D3 an illegal move??? Two illegal moves in a row is supposed to be a draw. How is King to D3 an illegal move? Magnus only made an illegal move because there was an illegal move\\n\\nThose words are enough to explain the answer They should both lose Magnus deserved to win because his opponent made an illegal move. First guy to make a illegal move should lose. Or people will knowingly do illegal moves knowing they can risk the other person not seeing it and not get sanctioned for it According to my school’s 4 square rules, Magnus should’ve lost The first person to make an illegal move should be the one to lose. What was the first ref thinking? First illigal move should count Magnus opponent offered a king trade 💀 I should win bc i cheat and he ignore 😊 Stalemate It\\'s like my brother who hit me first ran to mom complaining I hit him😂 Personally…I would’ve made a queen by moving my pawn to the end and grab my other queen in the 8th dimension and make it checkmate like google and chat gpt It should be a draw (my opinion) Doğdjsğskdpslxlxkdl The second judge is correct...the first illegal move should face a penalty. why is magnus\\'s last move illegal? How is king d3 an illegal move? Why don\\'t magnus just kill the king Magnus did not do illegal move.. his king move is legal.move . He just didn\\'t noticed the illegal move of opponent There should be rules that are black and white.not maybe this or that- in a good mood call it a draw in a bad move everybody loses 🙅\\u200d♂️ this coach say this that coach says that -rules should be black and white Logically magnus won if he\\'d just pause or capture the king because those are the only moves that can solve the blunder First ref was wrong. Game was over at the first illegal move, all future moves occured outside of what is possible, given the rules I dont see why that is an illegal move too? Magnus should\\'ve paused the clock Remis. In these matches is it the player\\'s responsibility to call check or the official\\'s responsibility?  Or there is no check call at all?\\nMy answer would depend on the responsibility. just take the king. oh wai- he should\\'ve just taken the king WHY DIDNT THE WHITE ROOK TAKE THE QUEEN  AND THE QUEEN WOULD DIE 😍 I think they shoulda just done takesi-backsies It should be a rematch I don’t even play chess but I like this guy. How is moving the king an illegal move? Am I missing something? Magnus win because the opponent was suposed to move the king Magnus w I think the senior judge is correct since he did the first illegal move Bruh why tf is it illegal let me ignore my check if I want to holeeee Magnus wins because if the other opponent didn\\'t see that he was in check, he loses the game because he gets his king taken. Who is the opponent of Magnus ? why is king d3 illegal ? I would just take the king 💀 Magnus 100 % won Take the king Uh... why is king d3 illegal? Start the position where it was before the blunder Magnus Carlson definitely won, what was he supposed to do? Take the opponent’s king? Why would that pos want the win based off cheating ? Magnus because he can physically take the king so Magnus won. What happens if you take the king in that case? The fisrt one to use the ilegal move loses The first illiegal move should be foul both should lose  for doing such amateur move What\\'s the point of a ref if they can not act on moves... let the players make the moves... but in the first fault he should of just L\\'d him as soon as the knight moved IQ:\\xa0♾ So his illegal move was ignoring his opponents illegal move and that’s what his opponent used lol Why is king d3 an illegal move? I’m sorry but I’m kinda new This is a true example of \"he started it!\" Match draw Maybe that shouldn’t be an illegal move? It encourages you to be smart'],\n",
       " 'NEW_WORLD_CHAMPION': ['no magnus in a wcc and still mentions his name.. this guy is the most magnus dickrider of all time.. In order to be the man you got to BEAT the man.  He\\'s the world champion until someone defeats him.  Him deciding not to defend his title was a chess move in itself.   Now the new \"Champion\" will forever 2nd guess his skills & victory until he faces Carlson Why do chess players shake hands like little girls??? It\\'s disrespectful. Grow a spine and look them in the eyes and shake their hands *FIRMLY* He deserves Someone tell me why people resign when they lose 💀 Frank came in and became the new champ “妈妈我赢了！”\\n\\n“我不在乎，你是医生再来跟我讲话。” he forgot to mention that magnus did not participate... Magnus wasn’t even in the match Queen c2 Congrats to the new champ 🎉\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHonestly i kinda annoyed how most people in the comment instead of congratulate the new champ, they keep talking about how magnus will win if he join the competition. Yes he\\'s great but give this man a moment of his victory. I need Magnus back At what part was I a part of history Ding liren: im so good\\n\\nMagnus: ive been world champion for 10 years mate youve been for 1 day I was about to say that was a bad resignation because of queen to f1, but someone explained in the comments he simply didn’t want to defend his title Tf this gotta do with me.. Never knew you could pronounce russian words that Well on a technically Hmmmmm, kind of think of it, we all are. For example...\\n\\n23 May of 2345 \\nA: Bro, remeber that story from 300 years ago about that one guy who died in a car crash?\\nB: No i dont\\nA: Same as a chinese chess player i was as happy af when liren, ding won the title Bro the first match was LITERALLY HANGING. MATE All while magnus is partying with the Botez 😂😂😂😂 Wow Can anybody explain what was stopping him from doing Ke4 instead of going back and forth It\\'s always the Chinese guy No I am the best now I beat ding liren  with 15 queens *2020 left the chat* *Me taking a fat dump*\\n\"Uhuh sure buddy\" Poor magnus, someone beat him in the same lifetime 😢 I feel like Hikaru could dominate in classical chess now Dude was so close to breaking the record 😞 Bro ur the real God of chess😗 Magnus😢❤❤ Ofcourse Ian blundered 😅 Bro, why didn’t they do a 1 game tie breaker Ding looks depressed still bruh just because magnus lost once dosnt mean hes the world champ It\\'s pronounced \"Ting Lizhun\"! i refuse to believe this nepo forever second Glad to see him get utterly destroyed! 🎉🎉 Puts *\"there\\'s always a Asian better than you\"* quite litterally guess im a part of history And without actual value since Magnus just wasn\\'t interested in playing against them 😅 pretty sour feeling for sure. Ian… THATS MY NAMEE I\\'m not good at chess (300 elo, give or take), nor do I stay informed about what happens on the chess world, but didn\\'t Magnus just didn\\'t compete because he didn\\'t thought anyone could give him a challenge? I might be wrong tho Nahhhh Ngl I forget how to set up the kings in chess I’m not sure why this was recommended to me As if Walter White started blogging Part of history? I am watching youtube. Also chess? I\\'m not sure that is what history will tell about this period 4 game tie breaker???\\nShould be an odd number Yh but how long will he last until mugnes decides that he wants he\\'s title back? Soo he isn\\'t the world champion cause he had other things to do than show up? Oh well still the champion in my book lol Surely he had chat gpt on his anus CHINA 🔛🔝 Idk why but my brain went to that Misha vs Anatomy Magnus just flexed on every current grandmaster out there he basically just didn\\'t want to play Those weren’t draws Who gives a fuck😊 Man those athletes burned so many calories that day.\\n\\nLegit. Look it up. imagine how it\\'d feel to be the best in the world.\\n\\nthat\\'s a very grand title. In football terms? \"You are a part of history\" means you can be anything and can do new possibilities Devastate Only because Magnus didn\\'t compete as he said he would.\\nHistory is fake, if you leave out the details. Well ain\\'t this funny the video above was Ludwig talking about how you challenged him to basketball lol how the fuccccccc am i part of history Why does it matter that the other guy won against him? He can still be better And that\\'s why Leon Edwards has the most aesthetic physique Why didn\\'t Magnus Carlsen play? And how thats gonna make me a part of history😂 Dude, I\\'ve seen Dblitz beat 16.26 in sotn, this is nothing. Mag daddy still can clap all of them For the record: Magnus intentionally didn\\'t participate in the FIDE championship because he wanted a specific player to be there in the championship to challenge him... Magnus in his house watching this \\nHahaha maybe I should spear out of no where 😂 still Dewa Kipas is the truly world champion Top 10 anime fights Magnus abdicated? Magnus Carlsen is like that kind of god that doesnt even care about being one cause it is too boring for him, maybe be shows up next year. Why does this translate to Magnus losing a title? Because this was the final match and he didn\\'t defend it? Yeah because Carl Magnussen don\\'t want to defend his title “Wherever you are, whatever you do, there’s an Asian better than you” - Master Ooguay I missed the part where that\\'s my problem. Magnus is still on top Magnus is the real world champion And that history ..we dont care ;)😅 Finally His reign didn\\'t end, he just ascended to a higher plane. No king rules forever Lol all that for a title nobody cares about. He\\'s more like a second-tier world champion. Magnus is just sitting in his own tier, bored because of how weak the competition was. He\\'s basically the shadow world champion. Ofcause it was a Chinese China China Someone else achieves something great.\\nMe: \"I am a part of this\" That\\'s because Magnus wasn\\'t interested to defend his title. stockfish: 5 missed wins Almost thought it was that one dude with the electric buttplug that was going to get it.

How did the Rooks position change during the Bishop to H3? My dumbass would sacrifice the king just to save the queen💀💀💀 Holy shit Hikaru be a legend If he moved the bishop not eating the queen. Maybe it would not be check mated Why are you yelling bro fuck stop And that\\'s why leon Edwards has the most sexiest physique Someone give this guy the \"master of ceremony\"  job in world chess competition!!🗿🗿 queen takes bishop , queen takes gueen and rook takes queen and he stopped the mate Why king don\\'t taken Bishop?????? His queen literally has more plot armor than itadori, denji and the entire demon slayer cast combined But what if he took the bishop? Levy Pinkman\\nJesse Rizzman (Rozman) Opponent: im fcked let me leave Bruh. That shows the difference between GMs and just normal players. Sure, we can try and see the possibilities, but is it ever difficult to find mates, especially in this scenario. What If Hikaru\\'s Enemy take the bishop? \"If a low elo gave up its Queen its a blunder, but if a GM gave up its Queen its a SACRIFICEEE\" Hikaru: *Simple Caculation* Hung the queen. Not a sac And this is what I call Zugzwang Now i know, I am no level to the Masters😔 When he say \"E1\" ithought he was saying my dads name pov: hikaru saw checkmate in 52 moves Not a loop. Aaaaaa Woooooo 🤯🤯 He can just take the bishop with their bishop I thought he sacrificed because he saw checkmate in 768 moves So the rook just magically changes spot He sacrificed only four times!! I believe that chess can be much more entertaining if there was commentators like levy Somethings wrong with the rook 😂with the first clip n 2nd clip \\nWatch People always forget how good Hikaru really is Hikaru\\'s definetely not a simp \"BISHOP TO H3!!\" 👹👹👹 Hello sir may I interest you in a queen?\\n\\n*That wasn\\'t a question.* Zuchswang!!!!!! King takes bishop Hes doing the botez gambit: rosen variation because it wasnt a blunder Yo naa can we talk about that rook randomly moving over a square\\n😮😮😮😂😂😂 What if the queen takes the bishop instead? note to self: never corner my king Why after Qd3 didn’t white take the hanging Bishop? My missed win according to stockfish Why the white bishop don’t take out the black bishop? Just don\\'t take the queen LAWL He ain\\'t nt no SIMP! Me: Okay one blunder and a brilliant move not bad\\nHikaru: No blunders but 3 BRILLIANT MOVES GOD DAYUM I\\'M DYING THIS IS ATROCIOUS For the last one, white could have just moved their bishop to g2 instead of playing around Where did the pawn that was threatening mate go Boy really made a new season of the queen gambit in a couple moves Hikaru be like:Takes takes takes takes alright Put the board little bit lower becouse it is not possible to se the last row, at least on my phone take the black bishop by the white bishop He was setting him up and build a defensive position early so his queen can move freely! Amazing genius. “Noooo cmooon take my queen pleeeeeeease????? Cmooooon pretty please?” first the castled black rook in F7 but the second time the castled black rook in G7 what? Bruh, why the king cornered \"he cant keep getting away with this!!!\" when levy said that i laughed out so hard man to make this move you need to be a true genuis this is why hikaru is the einstain of chess You alright there, Gotham? It kinda sounds like all the yelling is chipping away at your voice Truly the moment when GothamChess became JesseChess Then what if bishop capture by Queen? Bro really said fuck the girls I\\'m winning How did the pawn on g3 disappear after Queen takes knight? His opponent is crying so hard rn Where did the pon go That 1 pon U look hard while yelling Where did the pawn go? How did the rook move Bro sounds like a star wars voiceover guy I din\\'t know hikaru is grandmaster THE QUEEN The botez gambit 😯 So if the white bishop takes the black bishop then black queen can take the white pawn and it’s checkmate ? The transition was too smooth I watched it twice without knowing What I’ve learned so far in chess is don’t be scared of the queen and or your own queen being lost. Because, many of times the queen is hyper focused. I’ve had a player go down to my 7/8 lines and I ignored it and drove my knight up threatening his king while taking their pieces. How did G3 pawn dissapeared from the board in the 2nd scenario? Hmmm Did anyone notice that the black queen became white tho 💀 Where did the g3 pawn go? Does anybody know? Me on 5233 games (on my profile) \\n2 brilliant moves\\nHikaru in 3 moves has fooken 4 brilliant ones When did Hikaru move his Rook from f7 to g7, tho? 🤔 Gotham chess: D-3!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Me: wtf is this guy on about The like raspy voice is so funny Did the rook changed position from f7 to g7 or am I just dumb rook has also moved from f7 to g7 how is it? and pawn g3 disappeared or some moves you didn\\'t show us? where is black pawn G3? but could not white queen take bishop?( instead of queen and prevent check mat? ) Iis  not so? Levi sacrificed HIIIIS THROOOOOAT He sacralised the QUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEN But wouldn\\'t a queen on f3 be a better move? Dudes brain gave out Both players knew from the start that that queen was for the skreets. Queen can take bishop and the there is protection from rook🤫🧐 Where did the pawn on g3 disappear... That’s why I don’t set my king with a lot of pieces in the corner Where did the pawn on g3 come from? Don’t see it on the other mates he pointed out which website do u use to play chess online with others? can someone explain why the pawn g3 disappear?'],\n",

       "'Can I get pinned for absolutely no reason lol I think that blitz games should not be played over the board at all. How is kd3 a illegal move Magnus wins Magnus Carlson deserved the win since the opponent did the illegal move first I think both of them get extra time or it is a draw Wait, where was Magnus\\' illegal move??? Sounds more like the opponent and the 1st ref were co-conspirators😂 how tf did that 1st ruling make any sense??🤣🤣 First to make an illegal move loses. That\\'s how it should be ruled in this case. I’m barely getting into chess, so probably a dumb question, but why couldn’t magnus take the king ?? And just win the game ? Magnus wins the game should\\'ve been a restart because both players made an illegal move I mean yeah you can\\'t just ignore that you made the mistake first\\n\\nThat\\'s like you punch me then I punch you back then you complain to the teacher about you punching me and I\\'m suspended The first check should be lost Magnus\\' opponent was playing mindgames and was cheating because of the Magnus effect😂 probably declare a draw That senior ref got a nice check after that Sorry I\\'m probably dumb how was magnus carlsons move illegal Fuck it, capture the king Bro that referee must be a dumb af How did magnus make a illegal move i think i should\\'ve won Magnus Carlsen should’ve won this is dumb, why didn’t Magnus stop the game on the illegal move?\\n\\n& why was Magnus’ move illegal? What was illegal in move made by Magnus? This b!tch can’t respond a check with a check that’s illegal that should be instant loss Who make the first illegal move first lose because he make the opponent play the next illegal move Whoever makes the first illegal move loses, that first referee was high off his ass. Its not about cheating its all about that i ll take his king on my move and its over the game its all about who is gonna take the king first Wait how was what magnus did illegal? Best move\\nrook takes king I think magnus should’ve taken the king lmao Just curious how is magnus king to d3 an illegal move...?someone explain pls Magnus lost. I was for Magnus until I read the rules. The first illegal move was forfeited once Magnus played on an incorrect board. It’s like flopping in NBA 😂 Magnus win I think Magnus won because he did the right thing by responding to the check unlike his opponent!😅 The first person to make the first illegal moves to be the loser Does the man comparaing hitler with prophet muhammad How is king D3 an illegal move??? Two illegal moves in a row is supposed to be a draw. How is King to D3 an illegal move? Magnus only made an illegal move because there was an illegal move\\n\\nThose words are enough to explain the answer They should both lose Magnus deserved to win because his opponent made an illegal move. First guy to make a illegal move should lose. Or people will knowingly do illegal moves knowing they can risk the other person not seeing it and not get sanctioned for it According to my school’s 4 square rules, Magnus should’ve lost The first person to make an illegal move should be the one to lose. What was the first ref thinking? First illigal move should count Magnus opponent offered a king trade 💀 I should win bc i cheat and he ignore 😊 Stalemate It\\'s like my brother who hit me first ran to mom complaining I hit him😂 Personally…I would’ve made a queen by moving my pawn to the end and grab my other queen in the 8th dimension and make it checkmate like google and chat gpt It should be a draw (my opinion) Doğdjsğskdpslxlxkdl The second judge is correct...the first illegal move should face a penalty. why is magnus\\'s last move illegal? How is king d3 an illegal move? Why don\\'t magnus just kill the king Magnus did not do illegal move.. his king move is legal.move . He just didn\\'t noticed the illegal move of opponent There should be rules that are black and white.not maybe this or that- in a good mood call it a draw in a bad move everybody loses 🙅\\u200d♂️ this coach say this that coach says that -rules should be black and white Logically magnus won if he\\'d just pause or capture the king because those are the only moves that can solve the blunder First ref was wrong. Game was over at the first illegal move, all future moves occured outside of what is possible, given the rules I dont see why that is an illegal move too? Magnus should\\'ve paused the clock Remis. In these matches is it the player\\'s responsibility to call check or the official\\'s responsibility?  Or there is no check call at all?\\nMy answer would depend on the responsibility. just take the king. oh wai- he should\\'ve just taken the king WHY DIDNT THE WHITE ROOK TAKE THE QUEEN  AND THE QUEEN WOULD DIE 😍 I think they shoulda just done takesi-backsies It should be a rematch I don’t even play chess but I like this guy. How is moving the king an illegal move? Am I missing something? Magnus win because the opponent was suposed to move the king Magnus w I think the senior judge is correct since he did the first illegal move Bruh why tf is it illegal let me ignore my check if I want to holeeee Magnus wins because if the other opponent didn\\'t see that he was in check, he loses the game because he gets his king taken. Who is the opponent of Magnus ? why is king d3 illegal ? I would just take the king 💀 Magnus 100 % won Take the king Uh... why is king d3 illegal? Start the position where it was before the blunder Magnus Carlson definitely won, what was he supposed to do? Take the opponent’s king? Why would that pos want the win based off cheating ? Magnus because he can physically take the king so Magnus won. What happens if you take the king in that case? The fisrt one to use the ilegal move loses The first illiegal move should be foul both should lose  for doing such amateur move What\\'s the point of a ref if they can not act on moves... let the players make the moves... but in the first fault he should of just L\\'d him as soon as the knight moved IQ:\\xa0♾ So his illegal move was ignoring his opponents illegal move and that’s what his opponent used lol Why is king d3 an illegal move? I’m sorry but I’m kinda new This is a true example of \"he started it!\" Match draw Maybe that shouldn’t be an illegal move? It encourages you to be smart'"
